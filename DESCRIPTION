Description: This function FIREcaller is a user-friendly R package for detecting FIREs from Hi-C data. FIREcaller takes raw Hi-C contact matrix as input, performs within-sample and cross-sample normaliza-tion via HiCNormCis and quantile normalization respectively, and outputs FIRE scores, FIREs and super-FIREs.
