## FIREcaller Examples

In this tutorial, we will analyze Hippocampus dataset from Schmitt *et al*., ([Cell Reports, 2016](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(16)31481-4)), which contains Hi-C contact matrix of 22 autosomes from Human Hippocampus. Hi-C input files and the mappability file can be downloaded from [Yun Li Group website](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/FIREcaller/download.php).

### Setup the library
```{r init}
library("FIREcaller")
```

### FIRE and SuperFIRE calling
#### Set working directory

The directory should contain Hi-C input files of all autosomes and the mappability file required for the analysis.

```{r setup for working directory}
setwd('~/Desktop/FIREcaller_example')
```

#### Hi-C input file

As default, The Hi-C input file *file.list* is defined according to the naming convention of the NxN matrices. The HiC Input files need to be sample and chromosome-specific NxN contact frequency matrix with no row name and no column name.The files for the contact matrices must have the naming convention "\${prefix}\_chr\${number}.gz". For .hic and .cool files, it should be \${sample}.cool or \${sample}.hic. For .hic files, juicer is required and needs to be downloaded first.

```{r define the prefix.list according to the naming convention of the NxN matrices, warning=FALSE}
file.list <- paste0('Hippo_chr', 1:22, '.gz')
```

Here is an example for the required format of Hi-C input files.

```{r an example for the required format of Hi-C input files, warning=FALSE}
Hippo_chr1 <- read.table("Hippo_chr1.gz", header = FALSE)

# A subset contact matrix from 100 ~ 110th rows and 100 ~ 110th columns
Hippo_chr1[100:110,100:110]
```

#### Define the genome build

Users are required to define the genome build type. It can be "hg19" or "GRCh38" for human data, and "mm9" or "mm10" for mouse data. If missing, an error message is returned.

```{r define the genome build, message=FALSE}
gb<-'hg19'
```

#### Define the name of the mappability file

Some mappability files of different genome build (hg19, GRCh38, mm9 and mm10) and different resolutions (10 kb and 40 kb) are available in [Yun Li's's website](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/FIREcaller/download.php).

The mappability file needs to be in the format of column names as =c('chr','start', 'end', 'F', 'GC','M','EBL'), and the chromosome column needs to be in the format 'chr${number}'. The chromosomes in the file need to directly relate to the chromosomes in the process. For example, the mappability file will only contain information on chromosomes 1 through 22 to do an analysis on chromosome 1 through 22.

```{r define the name of the mappability file, message=FALSE}
map_file<-'Hind3_hg19_40Kb_encodeBL_F_GC_M_auto.txt.gz'
```

Here is an example for the required format of the mappability file.

```{r an example for the required format of the mappability file, message=FALSE}
# The format of mappability file
Hind3_hg19_40Kb_encodeBL_F_GC_M_auto= read.table("Hind3_hg19_40Kb_encodeBL_F_GC_M_auto.txt.gz", header = TRUE)
head(Hind3_hg19_40Kb_encodeBL_F_GC_M_auto)
```

Here is an example of the chromosomes present in the mappability file.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
unique(Hind3_hg19_40Kb_encodeBL_F_GC_M_auto$chr)
```

Users can also use their own mappability file in the same format.

If you have a six-column mappability file without the EBL column, you can use the script `mappability.R` with blacklist region data to generate a mappability file in the required format (i.e., with the EBL column). It has three options and can be ran from the command line as follows: 

`Rscript mappability.R -i yourFile -b blacklistFile -o outputPrefix`

where yourFile is your six-column mappability file with columns in the order of chr, start, end, F, GC, M, EBL and blacklistFile is the blacklist region file with three columns in the order of chr, start, and end. These two options should be the full file names with extensions (e.g., .txt or .txt.gz). The option outputFile is the prefix of your output file and outputs will be written to a txt file (e.g., MboI_20Kb_el.mm10.txt).

#### Define the bin size
Default is 40000 (40 kb). Other recommended bin size are 10000 (10 kb) and 20000 (20 kb).

```{r define the bin size,warning=FALSE}
binsize <- 40000
```

#### Change the cis-interacting regions
Users have the option to change the cis-interacting region threshold. Default is 200 kb.

```{r change the cis-interacting regions,warning=FALSE}
upper_cis <- 200000
```

#### Define if the input matrices are ALREADY normalized
Default is FALSE. If true, it will skip within-normalization step.

```{r define if the input matrices are ALREADY normalized,warning=FALSE}
normalized <- FALSE
```

#### Define whether to remove MHC region

The MHC regions defined in the R package are:<br/>

| GB   | CHR  | BP RANGE  |
| ---- |:---: | ---------:|
|hg19  | chr6 |  28477797-33448354                   |
|GRCh38| chr6 | 28510120-33480577                    |
|mm9   |chr17 |33888191-35744546 & 36230820-38050373 |
|mm10  |chr17 | 33681276 & 38548659                  |

The default setting is "TRUE"", that is, to remove the MHC region.

```{r define whether to remove MHC region, message=FALSE}
rm_mhc <- TRUE
```

#### Define whether to remove the ENCODE black list regions

The ENCODE blacklist regions are described [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45839-z). The EBL variable in the mappability file is an indicator of whether it is a black list region (1) or not (0). The ENCODE blacklist regions can be downloaded here https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists. 

```{r define whether to remove ENCODE black list regions, message=FALSE}
rm_EBL <- TRUE
```

The default setting is "TRUE" to remove the ENCODE blacklist regions.

#### Change the filtering threshold 
Users are able to change the filtering threshold, where if a cis-interaction is calculated by more than 25% bins that contains a mappability of 0, a GC content of 0 , or a effective fragment length of 0,then it is also filtered.

```{r define filter, message=FALSE}
rm_perc <- 0.25
```

#### Change the regression distribution
Users have the option to change the regression distribution used. The HiCNormCis method uses Poisson ("poisson") distribution, but the user can change to negative binomial ("nb")

```{r change the regression distribution, message=FALSE}
dist <- 'poisson'
```

#### Change the alpha cutoff for the significant p-value
Default is 0.05.

```{r change the alpha cutoff for the significant p-value, message=FALSE}
alpha <- 0.05
```

#### Specify if you would like circos plots for the FIREs and super-FIREs
Default is FALSE. If users would like to incorporate other multi-omics data, see *FIRE_plot* function for details.

```{r specify if you would like circos plots for the FIREs and super-FIREs, message=FALSE}
plots <- FALSE
```

#### Specify if you would like differential FIRE analysis
Default is FALSE. If users would like to perform differential FIRE analysis, see *diff_interactions* function fro details. Differential FIRE analysis can be performed between two samples when each has at least two replicates. Naming convention between replicates needs to be similar. Sample name is ordered alphabetically.

```{r specify if you would like differential FIRE analysis, message=FALSE}
diff_fires <- FALSE
```

#### Call FIREs and super-FIREs

Using FIREcaller function, we call both FIREs and super-FIREs for 22 autosomes of Hippocampus dataset.
  
```{r call FIRE and super-FIRE for 22 autosomes of Hippocampus dataset}
FIREcaller(file.list, gb, map_file, binsize = 40000, upper_cis = 200000, normalized = FALSE, rm_mhc = TRUE, 
           rm_EBL = TRUE, rm_perc = 0.25, dist = 'poisson', alpha = 0.05, plots = FALSE, diff_fires = FALSE)
```

In this case, two sets of files will be returned: one for FIREs and the other one for super-FIREs. If multiple (*n*) prefix's are specified in the *file.list*, there will be one file for FIREs and *n* superFIRE files.

```{r An example for Fire and SuperFire outputs}
# An example for FIRE output
FIRE_output = read.table("FIRE_ANALYSIS_40000_200000_poisson.txt", header = T)
head(FIRE_output)

# An example for super-FIRE output
SuperFIRE_output = read.table("super_FIRE_call_Hippo.txt", header = T)
head(SuperFIRE_output)
```
